# ü§ñ DIGITAL ASSISTANT FOR CALL CENTERS


## Overview
This project is an AI-powered digital assistant designed to analyze customer service calls. The assistant processes structured text data and applies three key analytical tools using LangGraph and GPT-4o:

- NPS Analysis: Evaluates customer loyalty and satisfaction.

- Sentiment Analysis: Assesses the emotional tone of conversations.

- Summarization: Generates concise summaries of customer interactions.

## Technologies Used

- Speech-to-Text & Diarization: WhisperX (Pre-Processing Step)

- Database: MySQL

- AI & NLP Models: GPT-4o, RoBERTa-based Zero-Shot Classification, BERT for Sentiment Analysis, mT5 for Summarization

- Frameworks & Libraries: LangGraph, Transformers, Streamlit

## Architecture

![output](images/architecture.png)

### 1. Dataset Preperation 
- Customer service calls are recorded in audio format.

- WhisperX performs diarization and converts speech to text.

- The processed text is stored in JSON format.

### 2. Data Storage
- Conversations in JSON format are stored in a database.

- MySQL is used to store structured conversation data with unique IDs.

### 3. Data Processing & Analysis
LangGraph creates a workflow that processes structured text data using GPT-4o.

**Three AI-based tools analyze the conversations:** 

- üìä **NPS Analysis**: Predicts and evaluates customer loyalty and satisfaction.

    - **Model used** : joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli‚Äã

        - Uses zero-shot classification to categorize customer feedback into promoter, passive, and detractor.‚Äã

        - Based on RoBERTa, a multilingual Natural Language Inference (NLI) model that analyzes meaning and intent.

    - **Process**
        - Customer sentences are analyzed using the model.‚Äã

        - NPS score is calculated as (Promoter % - Detractor %).‚Äã

        - Conversations with the lowest NPS scores are identified and reported 

- üòä **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the emotional tone of the conversation.‚Äã

    - **Model used** : savasy/bert-base-turkish-sentiment-cased‚Äã
        - A Turkish-specific fine-tuned BERT model.‚Äã
        -Classifies sentences into positive, negative, or neutral emotions.‚Äã

    - **Process**
        - Data is retrieved from MySQL, separating customer and agent dialogues.‚Äã

        - Each customer statement is analyzed and assigned a sentiment label.‚Äã

        - Sentiment scores are calculated, providing confidence percentages.‚Äã



- üìù **Summarization**: Extracts key points from the conversation to generate a summary.

    - **Model used** : ozcangundes/mt5-small-turkish-summarization‚Äã
        - A Turkish-specific summarization model based on mT5.‚Äã

    - **Process**
        - Conversation data is retrieved from the database.‚Äã

        - All turns are merged into a structured "Speaker: Text" format.‚Äã

        - The model generates a summary with a max length of 300 tokens and a min length of 100 tokens.‚Äã

### 4. Dashboard

- Chat UI created with Streamlit
